 brando_flavor_events.1.t: "Adyghe Rugs"
 brando_flavor_events.1.d: "Our people mastered the art of rug making a thousand years ago, and merchants from every corner of the known world have sought them out. Adorned with horses, birds, and other natural images of our homeland, our gold and silver rugs have become popular across much of eastern Europe and the Levant. The materials used in the making of these rugs are difficult to come by, however, as traditionalists suggest that the supplies used be collected only once a year during a particular season. With the advent of modern production techniques, we can vastly improve the rate at which we produce our rugs but we must forgo some of our more ancient rug making practices to do so."
 brando_flavor_events.1.a: "Let us move past outdated methods and embrace a future of industry!"
 brando_flavor_events.1.b: "Our ancient techniques have been honed over generations; we will never abandon them!"
 brando_flavor_events.2.t: "The Crescent and the Bear"
 brando_flavor_events.2.d: "The Sultans of the Ottoman Empire have finished their conquest of the southern Caucauses, and Great Russia looms down on our realm from the north. Stuck between two great powers, our nation's advisors grow nervous. Some suggest that we side openly with one of the nations, knowing full well that this would put us at odds with the other. The Ottomans are more than willing to accept new converts to the faith, and Russia's hunger for land could be directed elsewhere if we strengthen our ties to her. A third, more inflamatory option has also presented itself - deny both, and protest their claims on lands that rightfully belong to Circassia and her people. This would encourage both parties to act more agressively toward us in the future, but it would also show our people that Circassia does not need to bow before any foreign power."
 brando_flavor_events.2.a: "The Ottomans are the more pressing threat; let us side with our brothers to the south."
 brando_flavor_events.2.b: "Mighty Russia will protect us from the Turkish hordes; we will support Russia's claims."
 brando_flavor_events.2.c: "Circassia needs no protector; we will not grovel at the feet of foreign invaders!"
 brando_flavor_events.3.t: "The Italian and the Slave"
 brando_flavor_events.3.d: "Our womenfolk are known abroad for their beauty and grace, a fact that has not escaped the notice of our Italian neighbors. Many know the tale of Cosimo de' Medici who, in the early 1400s, took one of our women as a mistress and sired a son through her.\n\nIt has been a regular habit to introduce our most beautiful girls to Italian men as slaves in exchange for preferred treatment and economic favoritism in the region. However some amongst our people question this practice, allegating that we should denounce this practice in full, knowing that our women are strong in their own right and cannot be traded as a commodity, since they are as much a part of the Circassian soul as Circassian men."
 brando_flavor_events.3.a: "Continue the slave trade as is, we can't afford to lose these privileges."
 brando_flavor_events.3.b: "Cut all trading ties regarding slaves! Our women belong among their own people."
 brando_flavor_events.4.t: "The Return of the Salmon"
 brando_flavor_events.4.d: "Our people enjoy an abundance of riches from both land and sea, but the annual return of the salmon is perhaps the most important. As the salmon return to their spawning grounds each year to breed and die, our people are reminded of our connection to the land and sea and the natural cycles we belong too. Every tribe along the Pacific coast knows the salmon is a gift, and we must take special care to honor the sacrifice of the salmon. Celebrating the First Salmon Ceremony brings us closer together as a people and is a sign that the land gives back to those who treat it well. Alternatively, would could use this oppertunity to harvest more than our fair share and prepare a military force to strike at our enemies."
 brando_flavor_events.4.a: "Prepare for the annual First Salmon Ceremony!"
 brando_flavor_events.4.b: "Harvest the bounty of the salmon for our warriors!"
 brando_flavor_events.4.a.tt: "Prepare for the ceremony!"
 brando_flavor_events.5.t: "The First Salmon Ceremony"
 brando_flavor_events.5.d: "We celebrate and honor the salmon with feasts, song, and dance. The first-caught salmon is placed on a bed of ferns and cedar boughs, and after sharing morsels of the cooked fish we return the bones to the water to show the salmon people we have treated their gift with respect."
 brando_flavor_events.5.a: "We honor the gift of the salmon!"
 brando_flavor_events.6.t: "Abundant Acorn Yield"
 brando_flavor_events.6.d: "The tribes of the California region have harvested acorns since time immemorial. We tend the natural groves of oaks that populate our land and are able to harvest hundreds of pounds of acorns from a single tree. The entire village gathers in the fall to process the acorns for storage and to make acorn meal, which can be used to bake bread and cereals. This year, the harvest was particularly plentiful, and we must decide what to do with our surplus."
 brando_flavor_events.6.a: "Let us feed our warriors prepare for battle!"
 brando_flavor_events.6.b: "Let us prepare and store our surplus for harsh times ahead."
 brando_flavor_events.7.t: "The People of the Horse"
 brando_flavor_events.7.d: "No animal has had such a profund impact on our people than the horse. The nations of the Great Plains have embraced the horse as few other cultures could, and our people are no different. They allow us to hunt more, travel farther, and have tipped the balance of power in our favor. Horses are symbols of wealth - they are emblems of tradition, healing, and pride. We have mastered this beast in every conceivable way, and the horse is as much a part of our people as the earth and sky."
 brando_flavor_events.7.a: "Our warriors have adopted the horse and are fearsome to behold!"
 brando_flavor_events.7.b: "Our people use the horse to trade and travel ever greater distances!"
 brando_flavor_events.8.t: "The Islands of the Caribbean"
 brando_flavor_events.8.d: "The islands of the Caribean are stretched out before us. We have many opportunities to explore and expand into new territory, but first we need a way to get there."
 brando_flavor_events.8.a: "Our canoes will take us places!"
 brando_flavor_events.9.t: "The Potlatch"
 brando_flavor_events.9.d: "Among nations of the Pacific Northwest, the potlatch represents an important pillar of community life. A ceremony and feast, the potlatch is meant to redistribute wealth among the tribe, recognize the achievements of and confer status to individuals, kin groups, and clans, and to establish claims to names, powers, and rights to hunting and fishing grounds. Gifts are given, stories are told, and our nation is kept whole. We are presented at this time with the option to hold another potlatch or save our resources for another day."
 brando_flavor_events.9.a: "Hold the potlatch!"
 brando_flavor_events.9.b: "We cannot afford it!"
 brando_flavor_events.10.t: "The European Fur Trade"
 brando_flavor_events.10.d: "Europeans have traded in native furs for decades - even before they made settlements in North America, ships would stop along the coast to trade for furs. Now that the trade has begun in earnest, it has had a profound impact on tribal life. Our people are able to gain access to more advanced tools and weapons, and our trade influence among other tribes is vastly increased. As we compete to supply furs to greedy European markets, let us savor the advancements this trade has brought us!"
 brando_flavor_events.10.a: "We must engage in this lucrative trade!"
 brando_flavor_events.10.a.tt: "The fur trade brings change to our people!"
 brando_flavor_events.11.t: "The Decimation of the Fur Trade"
 brando_flavor_events.11.d: "While the fur trade brought a number of advantages to our people, it has also come with it a terrible price. Where once our economies were based on necesity, now our hunters kill as much as they can. We have decimated our traditional hunting grounds and the populations of beaver, elk, bison, and other animals we hunt for fur are in decline. Competition with neighboring tribes has soured relations, and the cultural impact of European goods and ideas on our people has had inumerable effects outside our control. Bands of our tribe have left to find new hunting grounds, never to return. With our participation in the fur trade, we have invited in new ways of life - ways that have pushed aside the old. We must adapt to this new social landscape if we are to survive as an independent people."
 brando_flavor_events.11.a: "We ignored the balance of life around us - we must live with the consequences."
 brando_flavor_events.12.t: "The Beaver Wars"
 brando_flavor_events.12.d: "Historically, the Beaver Wars were fought between the Iroquois (and their French allies) and multiple tribes throughout the Great Lakes and the Ohio River Valley during the 17th century. This war, or series of wars, of expansion was brought on by the fur trade - as tribes decimated their local fur-producing animal populations, they sought to expand their hunting territory in order to meet European demands for furs. Any tibe large enough to sustain such an expansion, however, could have feasibly done what the Iroquois did - so long as they felt they had the backing to succeed."
 brando_flavor_events.12.a: "With our new allies, we can conquer more territory in our hunt for furs!"
 brando_flavor_events.13.t: "Green Corn Festival"
 brando_flavor_events.13.d:	"Many tribes who practice agriculture have some form of ceremony related to corn - but the Green Corn Festival (or Green Corn Ceremony) is a specific type of religious and social event common among tribes in the Mississippi region and eastern woodlands of North America. The festival takes place over a number of days, and involves the ritual sacrifice of the first fruits of the yearly corn harvest. There is also dancing, feasting, games, and a number of other religious observations specific to the tribes participating. Another common practice during the ceremony is the forgiveness of wrongs - all but the most serious offenses are forgiven during this ceremony. It is traditionally a time of thanksgiving and communal bonding."
 brando_flavor_events.13.a:	"Hold the festival to honor nature's bounty."
 brando_flavor_events.13.b: "Hold the festival and take this oppertunity to encourage our people to better tend the fields."
